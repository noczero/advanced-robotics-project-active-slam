# Advanced Robotics Project Active SLAM

## Introduction

The primary difference of active SLAM or SPLAM (simultaneously planning, localization and mapping) and normal SLAM is to gain information of unknown surrounding environment autonomously. This involves additional path planning (how the robot goes to there) and control (where it should go to collect more information) mechanism.

In this project, its primary goal is to control the Fetch robot moving from one side to another in dynamic environment such as a corridor with collision avoidance in mind (for example, an emergency stop action).

### This individual project I did during July 2016 to October 2016 was for the subject Advanced Robotics at UTS.
